# A test script to demonstrate how printing works

# A print is always followed by an argument
PRINT argument
PRINT "literal argument"
PRINT {{ variable }}

# Note that if you run this script, the third PRINT prints an empty line
# This is because the variable has not been defined

# One way to define variables, is by performing a request
# The request will populate the last_request variable
# Which is null now
PRINT {{ last_request }}

GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
# But should have a value now
PRINT {{ last_request }}

# Some variables may have sub-fields
# These can be access with the dot syntax
PRINT {{ last_request.method }}

# Empty path parts are ignored, the two PRINTS below should print the same value
PRINT {{ last_request.method }}
PRINT {{ .last_request..method. }}

# Arguments can be concatenanted by not leaving space between them
PRINT "Hi mom! I "made' a "'{{ last_request.method }}'" 'request' to '{{ last_request.url }}!
